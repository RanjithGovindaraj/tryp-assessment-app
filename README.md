This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This contains the `DataTable` component written in Typescript with client-side sorting, pagination with support for server-side pagination. I have also added dark mode

## Learnings

I have used `Chakra-ui` for UI components. It has a very small learning curve and it was fun using it.

I have primarily used Javascript for my work so using Typescript has allowed me to speed up my work.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

You can visit all the components listed in the table of components
